# LEVEL 1 QUESTIONS
 
# DATA TYPES AND CONVERSION
# 1.  	Write a Python function that converts a string containing an integer to an actual integer.




# 2.  	Write a Python program that reverses an integer that the user entered.
 




# A question that may be used in lists as well:
# 3.  	Create a Python function that takes a list of strings as input, where each string represents a number, and returns the sum of those numbers as an integer.
 












# INPUT AND PRINT + IF, ELIF, ELSE
# 1.  	Write a program that takes two integers as input and prints "Even sum" if their sum is even and "Odd sum" 
# if their sum is odd.





# 2.  	Develop a program that simulates a simple ATM. Ask the user to enter their account balance 
# and then prompt them to choose between withdrawal and deposit. 
# Adjust the balance accordingly and print the updated balance.
 








# FOR LOOPS AND WHILE LOOPS
# 1.  	Create a program that reads a series of integers from the user until they enter a negative number. 
# Print the average of the positive numbers entered.




# 2.  	Create a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer. 
# Check if it's a prime number and print either "Prime" or "Not Prime."





# 3.  	Write a program that prints a triangle pattern using numbers. The user inputs the height of the triangle, 
# and each row contains numbers incrementing from 1.
# 1
# 12
# 123
# 1234






# 4.  	Write a program that prints the prime numbers in a given range using a for loop.
 
 
 
 







# LISTS
# 1.  	Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the sum of all even numbers in the list, 
# and prints the result.




# 2.  	Write a program that initializes a list with integers, removes any duplicates, and prints the updated list.




# 3.  	Create a program that takes a list of words as input and prints the word with the maximum length. 
# If there are multiple words with the same maximum length, print the first one encountered.




# 4.  	Develop a program that simulates a simple inventory system. The user can add items to the inventory, 
# remove items, and print the current inventory.



# 5.  	Develop a program that takes a list of numbers as input and replaces each element with its square 
# if it is even, and with its cube if it is odd.





# 6.  	Create a program that initializes a list with integers. 
# Replace each element in the list with the sum of itself and the previous element. Print the updated list.










# DICTIONARIES
# 1.  	Write a program that initializes a dictionary and deletes a key-value pair based on user input.



# 2.  	Create a program that simulates a simple inventory system using a dictionary. 
# Allow the user to add items, update quantities, and delete items.



# 3.  	Write a program that initializes a dictionary with student names as keys and their corresponding grades 
# as values. Use a for loop to print each student's name and grade. Update the above program so that it uses a for loop to print only the keys of a dictionary where the corresponding value is greater than 90.





# 4.  	Create a program that initializes a dictionary with words as keys and their lengths as values. 
# Print the words and lengths sorted by length in ascending order.






# 5.  	Create a program that initializes a dictionary with employee names as keys and their salaries as values. 
# Use a for loop to calculate and print the total salary expenditure.
